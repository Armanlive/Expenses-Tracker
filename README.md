# ðŸ’° Expense Tracker

A simple, client-side web application to track your income and expenses. Built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. Your transaction data is saved directly in your browser's Local Storage.

## Live Demo

Experience the Expense Tracker live on GitHub Pages:
[https://armanlive.github.io/Expenses-Tracker/](https://armanlive.github.io/Expenses-Tracker/)

## Features

*   **Track Balance:** See your current balance updated in real-time.
*   **View Summary:** Quickly see your total income and total expenses.
*   **Transaction History Table:** A clear table listing all your recorded transactions with date, description, income, and expense amounts.
*   **Add Transactions:** Easily add new income or expense entries by specifying the date, description, and amount.
*   **Delete Transactions:** Remove individual transactions from the history.
*   **Local Persistence:** All your transaction data is saved directly within your browser using Local Storage, so it persists even after closing and reopening the browser or refreshing the page (on the same browser and device).

## How to Use

1.  Visit the live demo link above.
2.  Under "Add New Transaction", select a **Date**, enter a **Description** (e.g., "Groceries", "Monthly Salary"), and the **Amount**.
3.  Click either the **"Income"** or **"Expense"** button.
4.  The transaction will appear in the "Transaction History" table, and your Balance, Income, and Expense summaries will update.
5.  To delete a transaction, click the **trash can icon** next to it in the history table.

**Important:** Data is stored in your browser's Local Storage. It is not backed up to a server and is only available in the specific browser you used to enter it. Clearing your browser's site data for this page will remove your transactions.
